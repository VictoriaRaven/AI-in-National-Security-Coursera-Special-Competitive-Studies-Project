## Information

This is a Free Coursera (no certificate) course called: AI-in-National-Security-Integrating-Artificial-Intelligence-into-Public-Sector-Missions created and published by Special Competitive Studies Project. The Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP) is a national security-focused think tank founded in 2021 by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt following the closure of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI). Building on NSCAI’s foundation, SCSP expands its scope to include AI, biotechnology, robotics, and other emerging technologies critical to U.S. global competitiveness. The organization operates through six core panels—foreign policy, intelligence, defense, economy, society, and future tech platforms—and regularly hosts high-level events to address the intersection of technology and national security. Recent initiatives include a 2024 AI+Robotics Summit, an AI+Biotechnology Summit (co-hosted with the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology), and global collaborations such as its joint AI research project with Australia’s ASPI. SCSP also conducts wargames with the RAND Corporation and publishes strategic reports on AI governance and defense innovation. As of late 2024, its board includes key national security figures like Michèle Flournoy and Robert O. Work, highlighting SCSP's growing influence in shaping U.S. tech policy in a rapidly evolving geopolitical landscape.

## AI in National Security: Integrating Artificial Intelligence into Public Sector Missions (Coursera):
- [AI in National Security (Free course taken at Coursera) (USA)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-national-security)
     - The Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP), in partnership with Coursera, created this custom course to upskill national security professionals in AI. SCSP is the premier voice in the national security space, driving recommendations and conversations about the crucial role that emerging technologies, especially artificial intelligence, play in the national security and competitiveness space that defines our world today.
     - This course will provide hands-on, use-case driven upskilling in AI for mid-career national security practitioners.
     - While many AI educational offerings are available for senior leaders, or as basic fundamental skills for everyone, there are no publicly available, free, and asynchronous courses targeting national security practitioners with real-world tactical applications.
     - Each module is designed to address different dimensions of learning how to use AI to be more effective and efficient for national security missions and why being AI-ready is so important.
     - Our lessons feature a range of senior leaders in national security who both demo these tools and explain their importance in operations today.
     - The course includes hands-on training with screencast examples and prepared worksheet exercises to help learners experiment with these tools on actual use cases across various career fields including operations, human resources, acquisition, policy, and financial management.
     - The United States will not maintain global dominance unless we make bureaucracy go faster and leverage AI tools at scale for operational advantage.
     - This course will advance learners’ ability to leverage AI tools today for their mission and to become a change agent in their organization to drive AI adoption at scale.
     - There are 4 modules: 1) Understand the national security imperative of being AI-ready and how AI is irreversibly being integrated into national security missions. 2) Explore how tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Copilot can be applied to tasks related to national security missions and their appropriate use. 3) Learn how to improve individual workflow in a national security context by leveraging AI tools specific to your role. 4) Learn how to advocate for AI adoption at your agency regardless of your role or seniority level.
