## Information

This is a Free Coursera sequence of courses about AI in National Security published by Special Competitive Studies Project. This coursera learning program having a series of courses: **SCSP Learning Program: Building the AI + AGI in National Security and Skillsets to Secure Tomorrow's Future.** The Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP) is a national security-focused think tank founded in 2021 by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt following the closure of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI). Building on NSCAI’s foundation, SCSP expands its scope to include AI, biotechnology, robotics, and other emerging technologies critical to U.S. global competitiveness. The organization operates through six core panels—foreign policy, intelligence, defense, economy, society, and future tech platforms—and regularly hosts high-level events to address the intersection of technology and national security. Recent initiatives include a 2024 AI+Robotics Summit, an AI+Biotechnology Summit (co-hosted with the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology), and global collaborations such as its joint AI research project with Australia’s ASPI. SCSP also conducts wargames with the RAND Corporation and publishes strategic reports on AI governance and defense innovation. As of late 2024, its board includes key national security figures like Michèle Flournoy and Robert O. Work, highlighting SCSP's growing influence in shaping U.S. tech policy in a rapidly evolving geopolitical landscape.

     - The AI + AGI in National Security microcredential is a three-course program—SCSP’s foundational AI in National Security course comes between two advanced courses on AI’s economic and societal impacts and the future of Agentic AI, AGI, and ASI—designed to give policymakers, strategists, and enthusiasts the expertise to lead in tomorrow’s security landscape.
     - **Course 1.** Establishing the State of Play of AI; **Course 2.** AI in National Security: Microcredential Edition; **Course 3.** Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) in National Security
     - **Overall Lessons for the sequence of courses:** Evaluate how AI transforms national security, competitive dynamics, economics, and global stability, and why timely adoption is crucial for preserving strategic advantages. Develop foundational skills in working with generative AI, large language models, and other AI tools—enabling learners to deploy these solutions effectively within their organizations. Investigate how agentic AI is emerging from current technologies, and assess its potential to evolve toward more generalized forms of intelligence—examining ethical, operational, and security considerations along the way. Examine possible paths to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). Grasp how these upcoming breakthroughs could profoundly alter defense strategies, economic landscapes, and global power balances.
     - **Overall Skills Gained for the sequence of courses:** By completing this sequence of courses, you’ll gain skills in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), ethical standards and conduct, business risk management, public safety and national security, open source technology, law, regulation, and compliance, emerging technologies, digital transformation, generative AI, artificial intelligence, organizational change, software development tools, business process automation, data ethics, ChatGPT, OpenAI, security strategy, and strategic decision-making.
     - The Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP), in partnership with Coursera, created this custom course to upskill national security professionals in AI. SCSP is the premier voice in the national security space, driving recommendations and conversations about the crucial role that emerging technologies, especially artificial intelligence, play in the national security and competitiveness space that defines our world today.
     - The course includes hands-on training with screencast examples and prepared worksheet exercises to help learners experiment with these tools on actual use cases across various career fields including operations, human resources, acquisition, policy, and financial management.
     - The United States will not maintain global dominance unless we make bureaucracy go faster and leverage AI tools at scale for operational advantage.
